# CRUD API Practice 🛠️

This is a practice project for building and understanding **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** APIs using Node.js and Express.js. The goal is to solidify RESTful API concepts and backend fundamentals.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Setting up an Express server
- Handling routes for CRUD operations
- Working with request parameters and body
- Using the `method-override` package to simulate PATCH and DELETE in HTML forms
- Structuring code in a modular way

---

## 📝 Real-World Analogy

This CRUD API mimics basic functionality of a **Quora-like post system**:
- `POST` → Create a new post
- `GET` → View all posts or a single post
- `PATCH` → Edit a post (used via method-override in forms)
- `DELETE` → Remove a post (also via method-override)

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Method-Override**
